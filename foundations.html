  <p> This is the beginning of the course about basic HTML elements.</p>
<ul>Here we'll get to know the foundational elements used to build a webpage, like:
    <li>Paragraphs</li>
    <li>Headings</li>
    <li>Bold text</li>
    <li> Italicized text</li>
    <li> Nested elements</li>
    <li> HTML comments</li>
  </ul>
<br>
<h2>Paragraph</h2>
<p>A paragraph element is used when we want to define a piece of text as a paragraph.</p>
<p>For a piece of text to look formatted in a similar way like we read it in a book we need to wrap the text content with a &lt;p&gt; tag.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong>
<br>
<b> This piece of code</b>
  <p style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <p style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;p&gt;Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <b> Will look like this in browser:</b>
  <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.</p>

  <p>Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.</p>

<h2>Headings</h2>
<p>There are 6 different levels of headings starting from &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;. The number within a heading tag represents that headingâ€™s level. </p>

<p>Using the correct level of heading is important as levels provide a hierarchy to the content. An &lt;h1&gt; heading should always be used for the heading of the overall page, and the lower level headings should be used as the headings for content in smaller sections of the page.</p>
<h1>h1 heading</h1>
<h2>h2 heading</h2>
<h3>h3 heading</h3>
<h4>h4 heading</h4>
<h5>h5 heading</h5>
<h6>h6 heading</h6>

<h2>Strong</h2>
<p>The &lt;strong&gt; element makes text bold. It also semantically marks text as important; this affects tools, like screen readers, that users with visual impairments will rely on to use your website. The tone of voice on a screen reader will change to communicate the importance of the text within a strong element. To define a strong element we wrap text content in a &lt;strong&gt; tag.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong>

<p><b>Input:</b></p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">The copy warned the &lt;strong&gt;Little Blind Text&lt;/strong&gt;, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.</p>
<p><b>Output:</b></p>
<p>The copy warned the <strong>Little Blind Text</strong>, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.</p>
<h2>Em Element</h2>
<p>The em element makes text <em>italic</em>. It also semantically places emphasis on the text, which again affects things like screen readers. To define an emphasised element we wrap text content in a &lt;em&gt;tag.</p>

<h2>HTML Comments</h2>
<p>HTML comments are not visible to the browser; they allow us to comment on our code so that other developers or our future selves can read them and get some context about something that might not be clear in the code.</p>

<p>Writing an HTML comment is simple: we just put &lt;!-- and --&gt; at either end of the comment. For example:</p>

<p style="color:gray; font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;">&lt;!-- This is an example of a comment in code --&gt;</p>
